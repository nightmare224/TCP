### Step 1:
#### - Question
<pre>
1. Set the parameters including RTT (15 ms), MSS (1 Kbytes), threshold (64 Kbytes), and the receiver’s buffer size (512 Kbytes), etc.
2. You have to transmit the video files in this step. A client could request a single file or multiple files in one command. The server should send the data to multiple clients at the same time. (You can use fork or thread.)
3. You also have to implement the data transmission (You need to ensure that the data are transmitted from the server to clients, and ACK packets are transmitted from clients to the server).
4. You have to print out the status of the server and clients. For example, for the server, which clients the server is sending to and which files the server receives in this step.
